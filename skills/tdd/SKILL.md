# Test-Driven Development

Use one observed failing behavior check to guide the smallest complete implementation for one accepted behavior.

TDD is an execution method inside the separately installed `execute-work` skill when available. One vertical RED/GREEN/REFACTOR loop is a bounded action, not automatically a Track Work slice. Several accepted behavior loops may remain inside one coherent current slice.

TDD does not define intended behavior. The accepted request, source truth, and user decisions establish what should happen.

## Follow The Behavior Loop

```text
[Accepted behavior with settled expectation]
-> [Choose stable seam and independent oracle]
-> [RED: write and run the smallest behavior check]
   -> fails for expected missing behavior -> GREEN
   -> passes immediately -> inspect test, boundary, or existing behavior
   -> errors for unrelated reason -> correct harness or diagnose
-> [GREEN: smallest complete implementation]
-> [Verify focused behavior]
-> [REFACTOR when useful, without behavior change]
-> [Verify original path and affected boundary]
-> [Route]
   -> another accepted behavior in this slice -> next TDD loop
   -> coherent extension -> approve and record when needed
   -> unclear cause or structural pressure -> Workflow
   -> supported bounded action -> return to Execute Work
```

Do not write all tests first and all implementation later. Finish, verify, and route one accepted behavior before starting another.

## Use Or Exit Deliberately

Use TDD for accepted behavior changes, bug fixes with a supported cause, consequential logic, and refactors whose behavior needs protection.

Do not force test-first work onto documentation, static content, mechanical formatting, generated output, or a disposable learning prototype whose result is not selected production behavior.

Stop before RED when expected behavior, failure semantics, or a public contract is unsettled. Return the missing direction to the separately installed `workflow` skill when available rather than encoding a guess as a test.

## Choose The Seam And Oracle

Test observable behavior through the highest stable interface that exercises the real requirement.

A useful seam:

- is used by callers rather than created only for tests;
- survives internal refactoring;
- reaches the real behavior or failure path;
- keeps setup proportionate;
- can disagree with the implementation.

Derive expected results from source truth, a worked example, protocol contract, or independent calculation—not the implementation algorithm.

Read [Test Design](references/test-design.md) when the test level, oracle, double, rejected state, composed failure, time or concurrency boundary, or legacy seam is unclear.

If testing requires owned internals, duplicated caller choreography, or production hooks used only by tests, return the evidence to Workflow. Use the separately installed `design-for-depth` skill when available only when it establishes design-bearing interface or ownership pressure; do not redesign merely because one test is inconvenient.

## Enforce The Test-First Evidence

- Observe RED failing for the intended missing behavior before changing production code.
- If RED passes immediately, inspect the test, observing boundary, and existing behavior; do not proceed to GREEN automatically.
- If RED fails because of syntax, setup, environment, or unrelated behavior, correct the harness or diagnose before implementation.
- Implement the smallest complete GREEN behavior. Use the separately installed `execute-work` skill's Code Practices guidance when available while changing code.
- Refactor only when it improves the result while the focused behavior check remains green.
- Re-run the original path and smallest affected boundary before returning the supported action and evidence to Execute Work.
- Do not claim TDD when the check was written after implementation or RED was never observed for the intended reason.

## Keep Tests About Accepted Behavior

Prefer observable outcomes over internal call sequences, real implementations before doubles, independent expected values, descriptive domain names, and one behavior concept per test.

Use fakes, stubs, mocks, or spies only at a boundary where replacement is necessary and the double preserves the fields, effects, invariants, and failure behavior the test needs.

Do not copy the implementation into the expected value, add production methods used only by tests, change a valid test merely to make implementation pass, or treat coverage and test count as proof.

Add an edge-case check only when accepted behavior, observed failure, material safety, or a settled failure contract requires it. If behavior is undefined, return it to Workflow. When related cases keep adding states, flags, setup, or patches, stop the behavior-loop stream and diagnose the shared contract, cause, ownership, or interface.

## Fix Bugs Through The Reported Boundary

First reproduce the reported symptom through the correct seam. A nearby failing path is not the bug.

If no reliable diagnostic loop or supported cause exists, use the separately installed `diagnose-failure` skill when available before selecting a production correction. After RED and GREEN, rerun both the minimized regression check and the original unminimized symptom or strongest available observer.

## Stop When Tests Start Designing The System

Return evidence to Workflow when test setup grows faster than behavior coverage, each case requires another public state or fallback, tests protect machinery introduced by earlier patches, the next check requires an unplanned subsystem, or making it pass expands accepted scope.

A green local loop does not prove the global design is right. Diagnose repeated or unexplained failure before redesigning.

## Report

Report the accepted behavior and seam, observed RED result, GREEN implementation, refactor if any, original-path and broader verification, current slice effect, and remaining unverified behavior. Return route-changing evidence rather than silently beginning another behavior or slice.

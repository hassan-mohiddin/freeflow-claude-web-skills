# Integration Options

Use this after inspecting branch, base, remote, dirty state, verification, and workspace ownership through an available repository tool. If the tool cannot expose the needed state or action, present the route as guidance rather than as performed work.

## Local Integration

Appropriate when the user wants the branch integrated locally and repository policy permits it.

Before cleanup:

1. preserve or resolve dirty state deliberately;
2. update base evidence safely;
3. integrate without rewriting unrelated history;
4. run the checks that prove the combined result;
5. inspect final log and status;
6. remove branch/worktree state only after success.

A feature-branch pass does not prove the merged result.

## Pull Request

Appropriate when review, CI, collaboration, protected branches, or remote integration owns the next gate.

Capture:

- target branch and commit range;
- intended push/upstream behavior;
- PR summary and source requirements;
- verification already run;
- known residuals, migrations, rollout, or compatibility notes;
- required reviewers or checks from repo policy.

A draft pull request may preserve or share incomplete work when that route is explicitly approved. State failing or unavailable evidence. Do not claim merge readiness from a pull-request URL alone.

## Keep For Later

Appropriate when work is valid but integration is deferred, feedback is expected, or environment ownership prevents cleanup.

Report:

```text
Branch / worktree:
Commit and dirty state:
Review / verification:
Reason preserved:
Next action:
Stop conditions:
```

## Discard

Classify what is recoverable before deleting:

- uncommitted changes may be unrecoverable;
- local commits may be recoverable through reflog for a limited time;
- pushed commits may affect collaborators;
- worktrees may be harness-owned;
- remote branch deletion has a different scope from local cleanup.

Show the exact destructive operations and require explicit confirmation that matches their scope.

## Detached Or Managed Checkouts

Do not assume a detached checkout is disposable. It may be owned by an IDE, CI system, coding harness, or external worktree manager.

Offer only routes supported by that environment, such as creating a named branch, preserving the checkout, exporting a patch, or asking the harness to close it.

## Conflict Handling

Mechanical conflict resolution is safe only when both sides' intended behavior is already settled.

Stop when conflict resolution would choose between:

- competing product or API behavior;
- changed tests versus changed implementation;
- incompatible migrations or data ownership;
- security, privacy, billing, permissions, or compatibility policies;
- two architecture directions.

Return the conflict and evidence to `workflow` when available. The next route may be review, diagnosis, `decision-gate`, Spec revision, or Plan revision—not “take ours” or “take theirs.”

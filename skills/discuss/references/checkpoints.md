# Discussion Checkpoints

Read this when closing or preserving a compact discussion checkpoint.

A checkpoint records enough shared understanding to continue or choose the next action. It does not mean discussion is permanently complete.

## Keep It In Chat When Possible

Keep the checkpoint in the conversation when the current context can safely continue. Use only the fields that help:

```text
Goal or question:
Current understanding:
Settled:
Tentative:
Open:
Evidence or alternatives that matter:
Approved or proposed checkpoints, if any:
Recommended or accepted next action:
Authority source or approval needed:
```

Do not turn a checkpoint into a transcript, questionnaire, frozen architecture, automatic spec, or complete plan.

## Preserve Selected Checkpoints

When discussion proposes or approves an execution checkpoint, preserve only what later action needs:

```text
Status: Proposed | Approved
Type:
Purpose:
Due boundary:
Conditions:
Approval scope:
```

Do not infer authorization from a recommendation. Keep local commit approval separate from push or integration, and keep migration, deprecation, release, and launch separately controlled.

## Preserve It When Needed

Choose the artifact by the information that must survive:

- **Working Record:** evolving task and checkpoint state, slices, decisions, evidence, history, and next action. Use the separately installed `track-work` skill when available.
- **Spec:** stable accepted content needs a separate durable artifact. Use `write-spec` when available.
- **Plan:** a stable ordered strategy and its selected checkpoints need a separate artifact. Use `write-plan` when available.
- **ADR:** a surprising, hard-to-reverse repo-level decision needs durable rationale.
- **Handoff:** one point-in-time continuation state must be transferred to another context or owner.
- **Domain documentation:** stable terminology or domain meaning belongs in an existing glossary or domain source.

Do not create an artifact merely because discussion occurred. Prefer an existing destination convention when one is accessible; ask before inventing a destination whose authority, durability, or ownership matters. Do not claim durable preservation unless an available tool actually created or updated the artifact.

## Re-Entry Checkpoint

When new evidence reopens discussion, preserve only the affected change:

```text
New evidence:
Invalidated assumption:
Still valid:
Decision, slice, or artifact affected:
Question or experiment now needed:
Authority or decision needed:
```

Do not restart from zero or rewrite unaffected decisions and work.

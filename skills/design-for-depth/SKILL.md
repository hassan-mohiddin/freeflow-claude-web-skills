# Design For Depth

Reduce coordination by hiding internal decisions behind small, stable, outcome-level interfaces.

A **module** is anything with an interface and implementation. A **caller** is anything that uses or coordinates the module through its interface, such as application code, another service, a script, a test, a tool, or an agent. Its **interface** is every fact callers must know to use it correctly: inputs, decisions, states, ordering, errors, side effects, configuration, timing, and failure behavior. **Depth** is useful behavior and hidden complexity per unit of interface knowledge.

A **seam** is a boundary where behavior, dependencies, or observation can change without forcing surrounding edits. An **adapter** is a concrete implementation supplied at that seam. Add a seam for real variation or a required testing or observation boundary—not imagined flexibility.

Use this as a compositional lens, not a mandatory phase or permission to refactor.

## Compose The Lens Early

Read this during design-bearing discussion before core boundaries settle. Use it while writing a Spec or Plan when ownership, interfaces, state, or failure behavior shapes the contract. Keep it available during execution, test-driven work, and review when the work must preserve those decisions or exposes new coordination.

Feedback may also route here after `diagnose-failure` establishes structural ownership, interface, state, or failure-unit pressure. Use that separately installed skill when available; otherwise require supported causal evidence before treating repeated failure as design pressure. Ordinary bugs, failed tests, or finding count do not prove bad design.

Do not force this lens onto a local change whose interface remains sound. Do not use architecture language to hide product decisions or turn reversible implementation detail into ceremony.

## Start With Outcome And Failure

Before choosing classes, services, states, or adapters, ask:

- What complete outcome should the caller request?
- Which decisions genuinely belong to the caller?
- Which ordering, policy, storage, retry, cleanup, or provider details can the module own?
- What counts as complete and visible success?
- If it fails, who observes it, what state or evidence is written, and what must never happen?
- Does failure stop, fail closed, fail open, degrade, retry, escalate, or require recovery?
- What is safe to restart, and what evidence establishes recovery?
- Which likely-changing decision should remain local?

The answers form the **failure contract**: failure modes, observers, written state, forbidden outcomes, retry or degradation behavior, recovery, and proof. The **failure unit** is the smallest outcome treated as one success, failure, and recovery boundary. Failure behavior is part of the interface even when its mechanism remains private.

When these answers change product behavior, public interfaces, compatibility, permissions, security, privacy, billing, data loss, migration direction, or another user-owned outcome, use the separately installed `decision-gate` skill when available or state the exact decision and wait. This lens surfaces the decision; it does not make it silently.

## Hide Coordination

Prefer interfaces where callers ask for an outcome and the module owns internal protocol.

Before exposing a flag, state, path, filename, ordering rule, retry, timing behavior, or error, ask:

- Does the caller own this choice?
- Does exposing it make correct use easier?
- Is it stable enough to become a contract?
- Could one outcome-level operation hide it?

Keep caller-owned outcomes and decisions public. Keep internal sequencing, storage, cleanup, provider mechanics, integrity publication, and optimization private unless correct use requires caller control.

Read [software design philosophy](references/software-design-philosophy.md) when the reason a design is shallow or coordination-heavy is unclear.

## Recognize Structural Pressure

Structural pressure exists when evidence shows that:

- each correction adds caller knowledge, public states, flags, retries, or recovery rules;
- one policy or behavior requires unrelated edits across callers;
- callers or tests duplicate lifecycle choreography;
- tests need many owned internals or production hooks created only for testing;
- a bounded outcome requires an unplanned subsystem because no current seam can own it;
- correctness depends on coordinated steps that no module owns.

These signals justify design attention, not automatic refactoring. Read [design pressure signals](references/design-pressure-signals.md) when code, artifacts, tests, or reviews show complexity spreading.

Diagnose repeated or unexplained failure before redesigning. Direct design work is appropriate when structural pressure is already observable or an important boundary must be chosen before implementation.

## Shape The Interface

When pressure changes the next action:

1. Name the complete outcome and settled behavior.
2. Choose the success and failure unit.
3. Inventory what callers, tests, reviewers, and future agents must know.
4. Keep caller-owned decisions public and move internal protocol behind the module.
5. Separate required trust and safety from speculative efficiency, scale, or portability.
6. For a structural or hard-to-reverse choice, compare materially different ownership or seam placements—not cosmetic variants.
7. Prefer the design with less caller knowledge, better locality, safer failure behavior, easier correct use, and proportionate evidence cost.

Read [the interface design loop](references/interface-design-loop.md) when materially different interfaces must be compared, evidence cannot yet choose one, or authority, canonical state, atomic visibility, replay, cancellation, or post-commit recovery affects correctness.

Do not force multiple designs for an obvious local choice. If source inspection cannot distinguish viable designs, propose one bounded learning slice with a question, competing designs, evidence, cost boundary, and discard-or-promote condition.

## Tests And Evidence

The intended interface is the normal test surface. If tests must bypass it, reproduce caller choreography, or mock many owned internals, question the module shape before adding test machinery.

Architecture-bearing tests should protect accepted behavior, observed failure, or a settled failure contract. Tests that exist only to protect unnecessary machinery do not justify that machinery.

Exploratory code may produce design evidence when an appropriate tool is available and the experiment is authorized. It does not become production architecture without deliberate selection through `workflow` when available, implementation as an authorized slice, and verification at the required boundary. Never imply that a prototype, test, inspection, or repository change occurred without observed tool evidence.

## Boundary Examples

- A core operation is being discussed, but partial failure is unspecified → define the failure unit and surface any owner decision before settling the interface.
- Every caller coordinates retry, storage, cleanup, and error translation → consider an outcome-level module that owns the protocol.
- One isolated condition is wrong while callers and the interface remain valid → make a local correction; do not redesign.
- Related failures repeatedly add shared states and caller rules → diagnose the common cause, then use this lens only when structural pressure is supported.

## Return The Route

Return the structural evidence, affected boundary, materially different options when needed, recommendation, and unresolved owner decisions to `workflow` when available or route directly. Recommend the narrowest route: continue, run a learning slice, revise a Spec or Plan, use a decision gate, propose a bounded deepening slice, defer, or stop.

A design recommendation does not authorize implementation. Do not expose speculative variation, broaden accepted scope, or refactor merely because a deeper design is possible. Freeze a supported design boundary instead of pursuing architectural completeness.

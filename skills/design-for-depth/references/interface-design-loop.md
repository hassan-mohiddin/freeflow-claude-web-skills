# Interface Design Loop

Use this when structural pressure makes the current interface suspect. The goal is to choose an outcome-level module shape, not add detail to the first plausible design.

## 1. Frame The Outcome

State:

- caller and complete outcome;
- source-backed behavior and non-goals;
- decisions the caller genuinely owns;
- dependencies and current constraints;
- why the current seam is under pressure.

Do not begin from existing flags, storage paths, or lifecycle states. Those may be symptoms of the current shape.

## 2. Choose The Failure Unit

Name the atomic unit before designing retries or resume:

- operation;
- slice;
- comparison;
- session;
- published result;
- another outcome specific to the domain.

Define:

- terminal states;
- observers;
- state or evidence written;
- forbidden partial outcomes;
- safe restart unit;
- recovery proof;
- whether partial reuse is a requirement or only an optimization.

When authority, integrity, canonical persistence, or proof validity materially affects correctness, also define:

- trust anchor and which actors can replace it;
- mutable state and canonical versus diagnostic records;
- authority or capability binding and replay scope;
- commit and visibility point;
- behavior when cancellation, integrity failure, or reconciliation failure occurs after an awaited or committed boundary.

Retry, resume, caching, continuation, and partial reuse are separate capabilities. Durability does not automatically require them.

## 3. Inventory Caller Knowledge

List every fact a caller, test, reviewer, or future agent must know to use the module correctly:

```text
commands / methods
parameters and flags
ordering
states and transitions
paths and filenames
roles and ownership
retries and cleanup
configuration
errors and failure semantics
compatibility and migration
cost and performance expectations
recovery
```

For each fact ask:

- Does the caller own this decision?
- Could the module own it instead?
- Is it stable enough to expose?
- Would changing it force surrounding edits?
- Did a recent fix or review add this knowledge?

A growing list is direct evidence of a shallow interface.

## 4. Classify Maturity

Classify proposed capabilities:

- **Trust:** needed to know the outcome is valid.
- **Safety:** prevents damage, leakage, or runaway work.
- **Efficiency:** saves time, requests, or money.
- **Scale:** supports concurrency or volume.
- **Portability:** supports additional hosts, providers, or environments.

Required trust and safety cannot be deferred merely to simplify the design. Efficiency, scale, and portability need accepted requirements or observed pressure.

## 5. Design It Twice

Produce two or three materially different interfaces. Change seam placement or ownership, not only names.

Useful design constraints:

- **Outcome-first:** caller asks for one complete result; module owns sequencing.
- **Minimal contract:** expose the fewest stable decisions possible.
- **Common-case:** make the primary caller path trivial while preserving failure honesty.
- **Real variation:** design around two concrete adapters or environments when variation actually exists.

For each design show:

1. interface and usage;
2. caller-owned decisions;
3. hidden internal protocol;
4. failure unit and behavior;
5. dependency/adapters strategy;
6. evidence needed to trust it;
7. costs and limitations.

Do not force multiple designs when the change is local, reversible, and source-backed.

## 6. Compare

Compare designs by:

- depth: behavior gained per interface fact;
- locality: where future changes land;
- correct-use ergonomics;
- misuse and hidden-decision risk;
- failure behavior and recoverability;
- contract stability when callers depend on observable details;
- test surface quality;
- reversibility;
- maturity fit;
- implementation and evidence cost.

Prefer the design that removes concepts and coordination, not the one that centralizes the same choreography behind more terminology.

## 7. Learn Before Freezing

If evidence cannot distinguish the designs, define one bounded learning slice:

```text
Question:
Competing designs:
Prototype boundary:
Evidence to capture:
Time / cost boundary:
Discard-or-promote rule:
Return condition:
```

The experiment should answer the design question, not quietly implement the whole subsystem. A proposed experiment is not authorization; perform it only when approved and an appropriate tool is available.

## 8. Return To Workflow

Return the structural evidence, compared designs, recommendation, unresolved owner decisions, and one narrow route:

- continue with the selected interface;
- discuss or ask an owner decision;
- revise the owning Spec or Plan;
- run the bounded learning slice;
- propose a bounded deepening slice;
- defer or stop because no worthwhile safe design fits the current scope.

Do not edit merely because one design is recommended. Recommendation is direction; `workflow` owns selection and approval boundaries when that separately installed skill is available. Otherwise preserve the same authorization boundary directly.

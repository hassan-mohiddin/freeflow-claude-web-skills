# Decision Records

Read this when writing or revising an artifact whose primary job is to preserve a decision and its rationale.

## Choose The Right Record

Use the smallest record that preserves the decision where future work will look for it.

- **Working Record decision:** task-local choice that affects later slices or current task direction. `track-work` owns its `D-` ID, state, rationale, and supersession when that separately installed skill and record are available.
- **Decision note:** durable product, policy, scope, compatibility, or technical choice that needs a separate document but does not require the repository's ADR process.
- **ADR:** surprising, cross-cutting, or hard-to-reverse architecture or operational decision whose alternatives and consequences must remain durable.
- **Owning spec:** keep a decision inside a PRD, API contract, technical design, or other spec when that artifact clearly owns the decision and a separate record would only duplicate it.

Do not create a separate decision artifact merely because a decision occurred.

## When A Separate Decision Artifact Helps

A separate record is useful when the decision is:

- hard or expensive to reverse;
- surprising relative to repository or domain practice;
- a real tradeoff among materially different paths;
- cross-cutting across systems, teams, or operational boundaries;
- likely to be challenged again without its original rationale;
- intentionally rejected or superseded in a way future work must understand;
- explicitly requested as a durable decision artifact.

Ordinary reversible implementation choices, task progress, temporary constraints, assumptions, and unanswered questions do not belong in a durable decision record.

## Write The Decision Clearly

Use the repository's ADR or decision format when one exists. Otherwise adapt this shape:

```md
# Decision: <title>

> **Doc ID:** DECISION-<stable-id>
> **Type:** Decision | ADR
> **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded
> **Owner:** <decision owner>
> **Source:** <accepted context and evidence>

## Context
<Decision question, constraints, and evidence.>

## Decision
<Chosen path and exact scope.>

## Alternatives
<Only materially different alternatives and why they were not chosen.>

## Consequences
<Benefits, costs, risks, compatibility, operations, and follow-up obligations.>

## Revisit Or Supersession
<Evidence, conditions, or later decision that would reopen or replace it.>
```

State proposals as proposals. Do not write an assumption, reviewer suggestion, or agent preference as an accepted decision.

## Preserve Authority And History

Name who made or owns the decision when that matters. A reviewer can challenge a decision but cannot silently replace it. A Working Record, Plan, or Handoff cannot supersede a durable decision merely by describing a different path.

When a decision changes:

- preserve the old record as `Superseded` rather than rewriting it to match the present;
- create or identify the replacement decision;
- link both directions;
- update owning specs, plans, or policies whose current content depends on it;
- preserve the evidence that justified the change.

Live evidence may show that implementation violates a decision or that the decision is no longer viable. Use `decision-gate` when available if resolving that conflict requires user authority; otherwise state the exact decision and wait.

## Avoid Duplication

Reference the decision from dependent artifacts instead of copying its full rationale. Keep task-local decisions in the Working Record unless they become durable beyond the task.

# Execute Work

Carry out concrete work through bounded actions and fresh evidence only when it was requested or approved, the current mode permits mutation, and an appropriate tool with sufficient access is available.

A **slice** is one coherent result tracked and reviewed as a unit. A **bounded action** is one implementation, experiment, correction, or observation inside that slice. One slice may span multiple Feedback Loop iterations and owning skills while its intended result remains coherent.

Read [the execution loop](references/execution-loop.md) when work spans multiple actions or slices, resumes from prior state, needs a specialized method, reaches a checkpoint, or reveals follow-on work.

## Follow The Execution Route

Use this as a directed map, not a fixed phase sequence:

```text
[Requested or approved concrete work; effective mode permits mutation]
-> [Orient and establish the current slice]
-> [Take one bounded action]
-> [Test or observe]
-> [Verify what the evidence proves]
   -> clear local defect -> correct -> test or observe again
   -> unclear, repeated, or route-changing result -> Workflow
   -> supported -> silent self-review -> freeze
-> [Route]
   -> more accepted work in this slice -> next bounded action
   -> coherent boundary extension -> approve and record when needed -> next action
   -> distinct result, authority, or evidence boundary -> Workflow
   -> approved checkpoint due -> owning skill -> route again
   -> supported exit -> report
```

Implementation beginning does not justify continuation. Continue only while authority, evidence, and the current slice remain coherent.

## Orient Before Changing State

Establish:

- intended result and the source that supports it;
- current slice, accepted scope, and relevant live state;
- direct check or observation that can disagree with the result;
- stop conditions, due checkpoints, and authority boundaries.

A clear user request can be enough. A small self-contained change needs no Spec, Plan, or Working Record merely because execution was selected.

Inspect relevant code, tests, docs, policies, artifacts, repository state, and current external constraints when suitable tools are available. Never imply that a source was inspected unless its result was observed. When sources materially conflict or the intended result is unsafe to infer, return the evidence to `workflow` when available rather than choosing silently.

When an accessible Working Record exists, use `track-work` when available for write-ahead slice state and later reconciliation. Announce the active slice once in a compact line when useful; do not announce every action or manufacture an identifier for a tiny task.

## Bound Each Action

Choose the smallest coherent action that can produce the intended result or useful evidence:

- keep unrelated and later work outside it;
- choose reversible local details from repository conventions;
- let an experiment fail safely and preserve its discard, revise, or promote condition;
- use only specialized methods and domain guidance that the concrete boundary needs.

When an accepted behavior change, bug correction with a supported cause, consequential rule, or behavior-preserving refactor benefits from a failing check first, use `tdd` when available for that bounded action before changing production behavior.

Before work changes the intended result, scope, authority, evidence boundary, or stop conditions, decide through Workflow whether it is an accepted extension or a new slice. When a Working Record exists, use Track Work to record an accepted extension before executing it. Do not let a series of “small” additions silently replace the original result.

## Execute For The Required Boundary

Match implementation and evidence to the work. Code may need behavior tests or runtime observations. Documentation, configuration, generated artifacts, and repository maintenance may need parsing, links, builds, diffs, structural checks, or installed-artifact evidence.

Do not rewrite tests, checks, Specs, Plans, policies, or accepted behavior merely to make implementation pass. Determine whether the implementation, evidence, environment, or source is wrong before changing what defines success.

When writing or changing code, read [Code Practices](references/code-practices.md). Prefer clear ownership, names, and failure behavior. Comment only non-obvious rationale, constraints, invariants, or temporary behavior with a real exit condition.

Handle an edge case only when accepted behavior, observed evidence, or material safety requires it. If expected behavior is undefined and would change observable behavior or scope, return it to Workflow. When related patches keep adding states, flags, or caller coordination, stop and return the shared pressure rather than extending the patch stream.

## Close Each Evidence Iteration

After each meaningful bounded action:

1. run the focused tests or observations appropriate to its claim;
2. use `verify-work` when available when the claim or observing boundary needs its fuller method;
3. when supported, use `review-work` when available for silent self-review;
4. correct clear local issues within existing authority and re-verify;
5. freeze the supported state and return route-changing evidence to Workflow.

A failed or inconclusive check does not prove the design or source is wrong. Correct a clear local defect; use `diagnose-failure` when available when the cause is unclear or failure repeats.

Further polish, advisory warnings, unrelated issues, and review findings without mutation authority are feedback to classify, not permission to keep editing.

## Route Continuation Deliberately

Continue inside the current slice when the next bounded action is accepted, its intended result remains coherent, the combined boundary can still be verified as one unit, no stop condition applies, and no checkpoint is due.

Before a distinct result begins, let Workflow establish the current slice outcome, then use Track Work when present to select the next authorized slice. A route through discussion, diagnosis, review, verification, or an approved checkpoint does not itself end or replace the current slice.

A Plan preserves intended strategy, not progress. Return material changes to its order, mechanism, dependencies, slices, or checks to Workflow. Do not add public documentation, migration, deprecation, push, integration, release, launch, or another separately controlled action without its own authority.

## Report The Supported State

Report the accepted result, fresh verification evidence and limits, material route changes, current slice or artifact state, and unresolved or unverified work. A supported action is not automatically a completed slice, and a completed slice does not authorize the next one. Never claim that a file change, command, test, build, repository action, or external update occurred unless an available tool performed it and its result was observed.
